# Spotify Visualizations Project

## Website
This project is meant to showcase how popular music has changed throughout history.  Throughout the project we explore different musical attributes which change over time.  View and interact with the website here: https://catherinetao.github.io/SpotifyVizProject/project.html

## Data Information
The data used for this project came from Kaggle.com.  From this site there is a Spotify Dataset of the top songs for each year between 1921-2000.  Features which we used in our project include tempo, valence, danceability, loudness, and energy.  Each of these features range on a scale between 0-1 and are determined by Spotify.
